               <h1 className="text-white ">What's the problem?</h1>
                       The idea for codeNewbies began after we discovered that many new developers (ourselves included!) find that they do not feel confident 
                       articulating what they are being taught and even what they already know. For many, learning to develop is very challenging and requires 
                       you to digest a myriad of complex processes and programs in a short time. Because web development requires comprehending such a large 
                       quantity of subjects, things as simple as terminology can be overlooked. This tends to create a fear of what development terminologies might 
                       be thrown at you in an interview by a potential employer.

                <h2>
                <h1 className="text-white">Where are we headed?</h1>
                    We aim to provide an increasingly comprehensive curriculum and environment in which fledgling developers can build their web dev fluency 
                    and impress any employer with their confidence.
               
                    From our experience, the web dev community is a close knit group that loves to be involved in one anotherâ€™s journey towards success.
                    Moving forward we intend to make community involvement a crucial part of our program, giving experienced Devs the opportunity to share 
                    their personal experiences and wisdom to the next generation of developers.
